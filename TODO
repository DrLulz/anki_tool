add switch to search case-sensitively

add way to invert matching, that is, to search for notes that do _not_ match a pattern, like grep's -v, possibly starting a pattern with a "!"?

add add_cards

add dump_cards, replace_cards
  include at least note's contents (reversed if ord==1 (or just print "forward" or "reverse"?)), tags, difficulty, scheduled date; search by note id (but in table cards)

add split_card
  create new note for reverse, but mantain card; for forward, only change model id

add dump_notes and replace_notes

add print_model (or list_field_names?), so we can know which field to use with search_field

add list_notes_by_model and list_notes_by_deck?
