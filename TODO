add switch to search case-sensitively

add way to invert matching, i.e. to search for notes that do _not_ match a pattern, like grep's -v (possibly starting a pattern with a "!"?)

add add_cards

add replace_cards

add split_card
  create new note for reverse, but mantain card; for forward, only change model id

add dump_notes and replace_notes

add print_model (or list_field_names?), so we can know which field to use with search_field
